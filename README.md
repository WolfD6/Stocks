To set up Discord for use with the Google Apps Script, you'll need to create a webhook in your Discord server. 
This webhook will be used by the script to send messages to a specific channel. Here are the steps to create a Discord webhook and configure it for use:

Step 1: Create a Discord Webhook
Open Discord:

Go to your Discord server where you want to receive the messages.
Navigate to Server Settings:

Click on the server name at the top of the channel list to open the dropdown menu.
Select "Server Settings."
Create a Webhook:

In the left sidebar, select "Integrations."
Click on "Webhooks."
Click on "New Webhook."
Configure the Webhook:

Give your webhook a name (e.g., "Gmail to Discord").
Choose the channel where you want the messages to be sent.
Click "Copy Webhook URL" to copy the webhook URL to your clipboard. You will use this URL in your Google Apps Script.
Save Changes:

Click "Save" to create the webhook.
Step 2: Integrate the Webhook URL into Google Apps Script
Open your Google Apps Script project:

Go to your Google Drive.
Open the project you created for the Gmail to Discord integration.
Paste the Webhook URL:

Find the line in your script where the webhookUrl is defined.
Replace the placeholder URL with the webhook URL you copied from Discord.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
var webhookUrl = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID/YOUR_WEBHOOK_TOKEN";

Email: 
Think or swim as and examply can send and email notication. 
That email is then routed to a Label.
That Lable is used to run the script from Google Scripts
The Script thhen uses a webhook to display.
The script can be ajusted as follows.
Time, labels, hooks, Subject line and amount of line sets.
This script can be used for news of any kind that comes in a Gmail account.
Not the free script account allows a large frequency, but you can over use it and lose 
access for 24 hours. It is therefore suggested that 5min updates as the max and setting times
on and off are idea to elimiate reaching a limit.
